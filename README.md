# Simple-File-Sorting
Just like it is named, it is a simple utility to sort files for anyone like me who is lazy to sort files by hand.
Created only for Windows. (Tested in Windows 11)

Setup is required before usage.  In the settings tab a "Category" will be the folder name for the "Sort by File Types", and
simply assign the file type that will be moved to that category.  Keep in mind that you must type exactly the format ie pdf, docx
doc, txt etc. Sorting by date is default to the YYYY/MM format, customizability of the date format isn't much as it must contain
YYYY and MM representing Year and Month.
